# Payment Gateway
This project is a dummy payment gateway designed to simulate the process of making an online payment. It does not involve any real transactions, but it provides a flow similar to actual payment gateways. It allows users to enter payment details, validate inputs, and complete a simulated payment with a success confirmation.
