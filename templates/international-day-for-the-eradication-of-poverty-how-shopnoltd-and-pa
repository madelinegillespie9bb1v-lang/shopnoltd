      <section class="post__content long-text-content">
        <p>The Caribbean Development Bank’s (CDB) Basic Needs Trust Fund (BNTF), the World Bank, the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (UNECLAC), and Kobo are hosting the second hybrid observance of the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on Thursday, October 17, 2024.</p>

<p>This year’s event begins with a workshop on Improved Capacity for Data Collection and Analysis for Enhanced Project Monitoring and Evaluation, from October 14–18 in Jamaica. Key experts from the World Bank’s Geo-Enabling initiative for Monitoring and Supervision (GEMS) team and Kobo will jointly implement the workshop with over 60 participants from the BNTF, the United Kingdom Caribbean Infrastructure Partnership Fund, UNECLAC, Jamaica Social Investment Fund and Creative Industries Initiative, as well as other CDB project teams, representatives from community development agencies, and other partners.</p>

<p>The training will be followed by the online Symposium on October 17 which will highlight best practices and lessons learned while seeking to inspire and equip participants with practical strategies for implementing sustainable poverty reduction programs. The global theme for Poverty Eradication Day this year is Dignity for All in Practice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Based on the success of last year’s event, we decided to repeat the collaboration while also adding the capacity building element.” -  Martin Baptiste, CDB’s Social Sector Division Chief</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Baptiste went on to explain that collecting and analyzing data accurately is crucial for informed decision-making across various sectors, including poverty reduction, environmental protection, healthcare, education, and government. He also indicated that interventions such as the annual observance for the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty (IDEP) allow for more targeted solutions to gain the development results that CDB is aiming for under their strategic objectives and priorities as well as maximizing Borrowing Member Country’s development goals.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We are honored to have the opportunity to collaborate with the Caribbean Development Bank and the World Bank in their efforts for poverty eradication. Initiatives like the international observance play a critical role in empowering communities with access to data technology and supporting sustainable and impactful development.” - Tino Kreutzer, KoboToolbox Chief Operating and Innovation Officer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Symposium will feature presentations by event partners on best practices and lessons learned from implementing projects to reduce poverty. It will also highlight the voices of vulnerable and beneficiary groups with selections from the BNTF, CDB’s premier poverty reduction program, and its Enhanced Country Poverty Assessment program.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The GEMS initiative is part of the new World Bank Academy and aims to create a public good by creating capacity in digital development monitoring. We are delighted to cooperate with the CDB and [other partners to] jointly leverage field-appropriate technology to enhance project effectiveness, development coordination, and poverty reduction for our client countries.” -  Bernhard Metz, Program Manager for the World Bank GEMS initiative</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The UNECLAC team will be collaborating on the observance for the first time and will participate in panel discussions and the opening of the event with the other partners.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Caribbean subregion is usually characterized as data-poor, not so much because the data do not exist, but because the data available are not sufficiently disseminated. This challenge is more prominent for poverty data. By improving the technical capacity of countries to collect, analyze, and disseminate poverty data, national strategies for poverty reduction will be evidence-informed, thus increasing their likelihood to be more effective in eradicating poverty.” - Diane Quarless, UNECLAC Caribbean Director</p>
</blockquote>

<p>UNECLAC was pleased to partner and to contribute to strengthening the capacity of Caribbean countries to collect and analyze data for enhanced project monitoring and evaluation through the workshop and symposium.</p>
